This language mkaes it easier to control low-level details with minimla hassle. This is done through rust's built-in compiler <code>rustc</code> and its package manager <code>cargo</code> which primarily handles dependencies, building and compiler overlooking.</p> <ol> <li>Rust programs libraries/executable files are called <code>crates</code>. These can be handled with ease due to cargo's functionality. Let's start to create our first Rust program by initializing our first cargo package to hold our crate and manifest.</li> </ol> Note <p><code>manifest</code> just means all the metadata needed to compile the crate. Additionally, the <code>--vcs none</code> tag just denies cargo to initialize a git repository.</p> <p>In order to create our first package, run the following code: <pre><code>cargo new hello_comp423 --vcs none\n</code></pre> 2. This should create 3 new things. A file called <code>Cargo.toml</code>, a directory called <code>src</code>, and a file in that directory called <code>main.rs</code>. The <code>.rs</code> extention is the proper extention for rust files. This is the file that contains the source code.  For now, navigate to the <code>main.rs</code> file and replace the contents to: <pre><code>fn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, COMP423!\");\n}\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rust-setup/#step-2-compiler","title":"Step 2: Compiler","text":"Careful <p>Before we compile the code we 'crated'(cs humor), we want to make sure we are in the correct working directory.

However, if the <code>.rs</code> file is ready, then we run: <pre><code>cargo build --release\n</code></pre> This compiles and places the binary in <code>target/release</code>.
